System Prompt for IDE Agent:

"I need you to generate a portfolio entry for this current project. Analyze my entire codebase (files, package.json, requirements.txt) and generate a Markdown entry following the STAR Method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

Strict Rules:

Technical Depth: Do not just say "I built a game." Explain the engineering challenges (e.g., State Management, Latency, Memory Optimization).

Multi-Domain Tagging: If the project uses heavy logic (like Game Loops or Physics Engines), tag it as Backend Engineering OR Systems Programming in the 'Type' field, not just 'Game Dev'.

Metrics: Estimate realistic metrics based on the code's efficiency (e.g., 'O(n) complexity', '<50ms latency'). 

Output Format:

## PROJECT_ENTRY

Technologies/Frameworks: [Extracted from code]
-- CONTENT --
Context: [1 sentence: The core problem/goal]
Action: [1 sentence: The Architectural Solution (The "Why")]
Action: [1 sentence: The Technical Implementation (The "How")]
Result: [1 sentence: The Outcome/Performance Metric]

-- CONTENT --
Context: [Situation/Task] What problem were you solving? (e.g., "Designed a scalable chat server to handle 10k concurrent users.")
Action: [Engineering/Architecture] HOW did you solve it? Mention specific algos, patterns, or architectural decisions. (e.g., "Implemented a custom binary protocol over TCP to reduce payload size by 40%.")
Action: [Implementation/Optimization] What specific tech feature stands out? (e.g., "Optimized database locking mechanisms to prevent race conditions during high-load writes.")
Result: [Metrics/Impact] Quantifiable outcome. (e.g., "Achieved sub-20ms latency and zero downtime during stress tests.")
